# Game-against-the-Computer

This is a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a number between **1 and 100** selected by the computer.

The twist: the computer gives feedback after each guess — whether it’s too high or too low — but in a rather sarcastic and unfriendly tone.

## Features

- Random number generation from 1 to 100
- User input and feedback via the interface
- Dynamic messages based on the guess
- Final message when the number is guessed correctly

## Technologies

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, `Math.random()`)

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a browser  
2. Enter a number and click “Guess”  
3. The computer will tell you if your guess is too high or too low  
4. Keep going until you find the correct number
